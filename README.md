# PalletX

ðŸš€ Drag-and-drop PDF uploader that extracts pallet IDs and inserts them into Supabase.

### GitHub Pages Deployment (Automatic)

- âœ… Push to `main` branch
- ðŸš€ GitHub Actions will build and deploy to `gh-pages` branch

### How It Works

- React + Vite + Tailwind
- Supabase writes on drop
- GitHub Pages hosted from `gh-pages` branch
